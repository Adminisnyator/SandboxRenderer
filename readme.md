## Building
Install raylib either through your package manager or by cloning it.
For instance with fedora you would:
```
$ sudo dnf install raylib-devel
$ make
```
If you want to build it without automatically running it you can also call.
```
$ make build-tiny-quake
$ make run-tiny-quake
```
Please be aware that through differences between OS and windowing systems as well as
hardware you might get a different behaviour from the program than the author intended.
